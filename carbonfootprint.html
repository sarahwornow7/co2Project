<h1 style = font-size:50px;color:#05990C;><b>Carbon Footprint</b></h1>
<h2 id = "geninfo" >General Information</b></h2>
  <p><em><b>What is a carbon footprint</em></b></p>
  <p>A carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide and other carbon compounds
    emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person or group. 
    The term footprint refers to the impact that we have on the Earth. By adding the word 
    carbon to the beginning we get the phrase carbon footprint which is the amount of 
    carbon dioxide we are creating.</p>
  
  <p><em><b>Why is my carbon footprint important</b></em></p>
  <p> Your carbon footprint is important, because it tells you how much of an impact you are having on our environment.
  If everyone worked to decrease their own carbon footprint by driving electric cars, cutting out beef and dairy, and using less
  water then we would be in a drastically different climate situation.</p>

<h3 id = "reduction"><b>Reducing Your Carbon Footprint</b></h3>
  <p><b><em>Ways to reduce my carbon footprint</em></b></p>
<p><b>Diet</b></p>
  <p><i>Eat locally produced and organic food</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li> 13% of US Greenhouse gas emissions results from the production and transportation of food </li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>Cut out beef and dairy</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li> It takes a lot of resources to rause cows</li>
    <li> Methane is produced from the animals' bodily waste and methan is another destructive greenhouse gas.</li>
    <li> Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of Greenhouse Gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation</li>
    <li> Livestock and their byproducts are responsible for at least 32 billion tons of carbon dioxide
    per year or 51% of all world wide greenhouse emissions</li>
    <li> Emissions for agriculture projects are supposed to increase by 80% by 2050</li>
    <li> Cows produce 150 billion gallons of methane per day</li>
    </ul>
      <p style= font-size: 20px><b>Compost your food waste</b></p>

  <li> <a href = https://evobsession.com/10-best-electric-cars/> electric cars</a>
  emit no CO<sub>2</sub> if they are charged with <a href = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/clean-electricity>
  clean electricity</a>. </li>
<li> Properly inflated tires can improve your mileage by up to 3% </li>
