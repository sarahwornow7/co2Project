    <h1 id = "general" style="color:#05990C"><center><b>General Questions</b></center></h1>
        <p><em><b>Is there a difference between climate change and global warming?</b></em></p>
            <p>Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet over the last several decades. However,
            climate change includes global warming. It also refers to other violently changing elements <pr>in nature, especially
            natural disaters (wildfires and hurricanes), melting glaciers, and accelerating ice melts in the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
        <p><em><b>Is the sun causing global warming?</b></em></p>
            <p>The sun does not cause global warming. A series of satellite reports that have measured the energy output from <br>
                the sun since 1978 have shown a decrease in energy output from the sun over that period. </p>
        <p><em><b>Can we still prevent climate change?</b></em></p>
            <p>Yes! We can still prevent climate change, but it will take cooperation from all countries and governments. We will <br>
                have to introduce radical policies to address these problems. If we can't change policies, then <br>
                some experts fear the damage will become irreversible in just two years. Climate scientists believe that <br>
                if we can reduce climate change by 2020, then we will avoid the risk of irreversible climate change. </p>
        <p><em><b>Do scientists agree on climate change?</b></em></p>
                <p> Yes, the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is occurring. In fact, the percentage is 97% and rising. </p>
        <p id="greenhouse"><em><b>What is the greenhouse effect?</b></em></p>
                <p>The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases gather in Earth's atmosphere and stay there for a prolonged <br>
                 amount of time. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, nitruous oxide, water vapor<br>
                 (which is not harmful), and ozone. Greenhouse gases prevent heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere. <br>
      	<center><img src="GreenhouseEffect.jpg" height="250px" width="350px" alt="Greenhouse Effect"/></center><br>
        <p><em><b>What is the most harmful greenhouse gas?</b></em></p>
                <p> There is a lot of disagreement regarding the most dangerous greenhouse gas. Because CO<sub>2</sub> remains <br>
                 in the atmosphere for a century and because of its concentration, CO<sub>2</sub><br>
                 is the most destructive greenhouse gas. Make no mistake, decreasing your footprint of any harmful gases<br>
                 is helpful to the environment. </p>
        <p><em><b>Why do some areas experience cooling instead of warming?</b></em></p>
                 <p>Climate change includes all natural disasters that happen as a result of global warming. So, while some areas experience annual<br>
                 cooling because of snowstorms, rainstorms, and hailstorms, the annual <br>
                 temperature value around the world continues to rise.</p>
        <p><em><b>Are humans causing global warming?</b></em></p>
                <p> Yes. Scientists have concluded that global warming is caused by burning coal, oil, and gas, and by agricultrue. These are all manmade activities that we control.</p>
        <p><em><b>Don't volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans?</b></em></p>
                 <p> Volcanoes emit 645 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, while humans emit around 29 billion tons of<br>
                 CO<sub>2</sub> per year. Volcanoes, therefore, emit only .02% of all carbon dioxide emmisions. <br>
                 Human pollution causes the remainder.</p>               
        <p><em><b>Is global warming actually harmful?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Yes, global warming is harmful because it causes extreme weather changes and natural disasters. <br>
                  Global warming causes rising sea levels (which will cause islands and entire states to become submerged <br>
                  in water by the year 2100), ocean acidification (so that the oceans may no longer be able to sustain life forms by the year 2100, and<br>
                  humans would be advised to not go into the water), wildfires, hurricanes, and even more sporadic natural disasters. So yes, global<br>
                  warming is, in fact, harmful to us.</p>
	<br><center><img src="sealevels.gif" height="250px" width="350px" alt="sealevels"/></center><br>
        <p><em><b>Can we reverse global warming?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Yes, but if we wait too long the effects of global warming will become permanent. In order for us to reverse our current climate <br>
                  situation, we need to meet our carbon reduction goals, and lower our output of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
			  <br><center><img src="temp.gif" width="350px" height="350px"/></center><br>
	<p><em><b>Are there any economic policies that help limit carbon emissions?</p></em></b>
                  <p>Yes, there are two options to lower emissions. The first is the carbon tax, which imposes a fee on the production and <br>
                  distribution of carbon and sets a price for producing dirty oils. The carbon tax encourages companies to use clean energy and <br>
                  to invest in energy efficiency. The second option for lowering emissions is cap and trade. In cap and trade, the government sets a cap on emissions.<br>
                  Allowances are allocated to different businesses, with the unallocated portion<br>
                  auctioned off to the highest bidder. Companies that use more than their allocated carbon share are taxed. They may decide not to use some of<br>
                  their carbon allowance and instead sell it to other companies.</p>

    <p><em><b>Do I have to be vegan?</b></em></p>
                  <p>While being vegan would decrease your carbon footprint, that is not the only answer to this very complex problem.<br>
                  The main two foods to eliminate to reduce carbon would be red meat and dairy.<br>
                  </p>
        <p><em><b>How do I transition to a plant based diet?</b></em></p>
                  <p>Start slowly. Don't get overwhelmed by cravings. If you usually eat red meat everyday, try<br>
                  only eating it for four days out of the seven. When you adjust, reduce it to two days a week, and then try to stop <br>
                  eating it entirely. Do the same thing with dairy if you're up for it, but make sure it's a gradual change so that you don't succumb to cravings.</p>
        <p><em><b>How do I get my protein?</b></em></p>
                  <p>People with a plant based diet may get their protein several ways. Nuts, beans, legumes, quinoa, soy products <br>
                  and hummus will provide protein. And, if you don't like any of these food options, then there are a number of different protein powders, drinks, and bars that <br>
                  are dairy free.</p>
