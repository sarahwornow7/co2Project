    <h1 id = "general" style="color:#05990C"><center><b>General Questions</b></center></h1>
        <p><em><b>Is there a difference between climate change and global warming?</b></em></p>
            <p>Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet over the last several decades. However,<br>
            climate change includes global warming. It also refers to other violently changing elements <pr>in nature, especially<br>
            natural disaters (wildfires and hurricanes), melting glaciers, and accelerating ice melts in the Arctic and Antarctic.</p>
        <p><em><b>Is the sun causing global warming?</b></em></p>
            <p>The sun does not cause global warming. A series of satellite reports that have measured the energy output from <br>
                the sun since 1978 have shown a decrease in energy output from the sun over that period. </p>
        <p><em><b>Can we still prevent climate change?</b></em></p>
            <p>Yes! We can still prevent climate change, but it will take cooperation from all countries and governments. We will <br>
                have to introduce radical policies to address these problems. If we can't change policies, then <br>
                some experts fear the damage will become irreversible in just two years. Climate scientists believe that <br>
                if we can reduce climate change by 2020, then we will avoid the risk of irreversible climate change. </p>
        <p><em><b>Do scientists agree on climate change?</b></em></p>
                <p> Yes, the vast majority of scientists agree that climate change is occurring. In fact, the percentage is 97% and rising. </p>
        <p id="greenhouse"><em><b>What is the greenhouse effect?</b></em></p>
                <p>The greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases gather in Earth's atmosphere and stay there for a prolonged <br>
                 amount of time. The greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitruous oxide, water vapor (part of the precipitation cycle<br>
                 so it is not harmful), and ozone. The greenhouse gases allow the sun's light to shine through onto Earth and past the <br>
                 atmosphere and keeps the heat from leaving. Much in the way that a real greenhouse works, letting heat in so the plants can<br>
                 photosynthesize and trapping the heat so that the plants continue to grow.</p> <br> 
	<center><img src="GreenhouseEffect.jpg" height="250px" width="350px" alt="Greenhouse Effect"/></center><br>
        <p><em><b>What is the most harmful greenhouse gas?</b></em></p>
                <p> There is a lot of disagreement over what the most dangerous greenhouse gas is, but because of CO<sub>2</sub>'s ability to <br>
                 stay in the atmosphere for a century, its concentration, and methane's ability to turn in CO<sub>2</sub> the cards are all in favor <br>
                 of CO<sub>2</sub> for the most destructive greenhouse gas. Make no mistake, your ability to try and decrease your footprint of any of<br>
                 the gases is helpful to the environment. </p>
        <p><em><b>Why do some areas experience cooling instead of warming?</b></em></p>
                <p> Some areas experience cooling, because the overall effects of global warming can be contained in the phrase climate change.<br>
                 Climate change refers to all of the natural disasters that happen as a result of global warming. So, some areas may experience annual<br>
                 cooling because of the occurence of snowstorms, rainstorms, hailstorms etc. And even though some areas experience cooling the overall <br>
                 annual temperature value for the world continues to rise.</p>
        <p><em><b>Are humans causing global warming?</b></em></p>
                <p> Yes. Scientists have concluded that global warming is caused by the burning of coal, oil, gas, and by agricultrue. </p>
        <p><em><b>Don't volcanoes emit more carbon dioxide than humans?</b></em></p>
                 <p> By the largest estimate, volcanoes emit 645 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> per year while humans emit around 29 billion tons of<br>
                 CO<sub>2</sub> per year. Comparatively volcanoes only emit a measly .02% of all carbon dioxide emmisions and I think we knoe what is <br>
                 causing the vast majority of the remaining 99.98%. Human pollution.</p>               
        <p><em><b>Is global warming actually harmful?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Yes, global warming is actually harmful, because it catalyzes extreme weather changes and natural disasters. The <br>
                  disastrous effects of global warming are rising sea levels (which will cause islands and entire states to become submerged <br>
                  in water by the year 2100), ocean acidification (the ocean may no longer be able to sustain some life forms by the year 2100, and<br>
                  humans would be advised to not go into the water), wildfires, hurricanes, and even more sporadic natural disasters. So yes, global<br>
                  warming is, in fact, harmful to us moreso than it is to the planet.</p>
	<br><center><img src="sealevels.gif" height="250px" width="350px" alt="sealevels"/></center><br>
        <p><em><b>Are there benefits to global warming?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Yes, but in the grand scheme of things no. For most coutnries there is nothing to gain, but for China, they could see their <pr>
                  dry areas beginning to get rainfall and their flooding areas begin to get drier, but these effects would come with great consequences <pr>
                  for china and the rest of the world too. This favorable change in climate would be short-lived, because the overall negative effects of <br>
                  climate change (violent disasters, melting ice caps, animal extinction) would continue to impact the globe.</p>
        <p><em><b>Can we reverse global warming?</b></em></p>
                  <p> For now, yes, but if we wait too long the effects of global warming will become permanent. In order for us to reverse out current climate <br>
                  situation we need to actually meet our carbon goals, and began to level out and lower our output of CO<sub>2</sub> per year.</p>
			  <br><center><img src="temp.gif" width="350px" height="350px"/></center><br>
	<p><em><b>Hasn't Earth warmed and cooled naturally throughout history?</b></em></p>
                  <p> Monitoring climate conditions has showed us that the gradual rise in CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere correlates <br>
                  with the man-made CO<sub>2</sub> emissions </p>
        <p><em><b>Are there any economic policies that help limit carbon emissions?</p></em></b>
                  <p>There are two options to lower emissions. The first is the carbon tax. Carbon tax levies a fee on the production and <br>
                  distribution of carbon and sets a price for producing dirtier oils. The carbon tax encourages companies to use clean energy and <br>
                  invest into energy efficiency. The secons option for lowering emissions is cap and trade. Cap and trade is when a cap is set <br>
                  by the government and allowances are allocated to different businesses in connection with the government and the rest of the carbon is <br>
                  is auctioned off to the highest bidder. Companies that use more than their allocated carbon are taxed, but if they decide not to use some <br>
                  their allowed carbon then they can sell it to other companies.</p>

        <p><em><b>What is C40?</p></em></b>
                      <p>C40 is a group of cities that connect over 600 million people to tackle climate change and reduce carbon emissions. </p>

    <p><em><b>Do I have to be vegan?</b></em></p>
                  <p>While being vegan would decrease your carbon output exponentially, that is not the only answer to this very complex problem.<br>
                  The main two dietary foods that you should cut out are red meat and dairy. Even limiting your consumption of these foods would be better.<br>
                  </p>
        <p><em><b>How do I transition to a plant based diet?</b></em></p>
                  <p>It would be best if you started out slowly, so that you aren't completely overwhelmed by cravings. If you usually eat red meat everyday. Try<br>
                  only eating it for four days out of the seven. When you begin to get used to this, move it down to around two days a week, and then try to stop <br>
                  eating it entirely. Do the same thing with dairy if you're up for it, but make sure it's a gradual change so that you don't succumb to your cravings.</p>
        <p><em><b>Are there any good meat replacements?</b></em></p>
                  <p>Yes! There are lots of wonderful companies that produce meat free and dairy free products, one of the best reviewed companies is <br>
                     <a href = www.morningstar.com>Morning Star</a> is delicious<br></p>

        <p><em><b>How do I get my protein?</b></em></p>
                  <p>There are a number of ways that people with a plant based diet get their protein. Nuts, beans, legumes, quinoa, soy products <br>
                  and hummus. And, if you don't like any of these food options then there are a number of different protein powders, drinks, and bars that <br>
                  are dairy free.</p>
